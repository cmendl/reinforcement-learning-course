Python 3 and NumPy


Exercises
---------

Markov Decision Processes (MDPs):
1. complete `mdp_template.py` (reference solution in `mdp.py`, but at least try to solve `mdp_template.py` first)
2. open `run_simple_maze.ipynb`, get acquainted with the framework and execute the notebook

Policy gradients:
1. complete `pg_template.py` (reference solution in `pg.py`)
2. `run_simple_maze_policy_gradients.ipynb`
